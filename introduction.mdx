## About the D3 Business API

The **D3 Business API** is a high‑throughput, file‑centric API for developers who want to integrate D3's conversion, compression, merge, zip, and PDF utilities directly into their products.

At a high level the system consists of:

- **API Routes** – Entry point for all external requests, applying IP filtering and authentication.
- **Middleware** – API key authentication.
- **External API Handler** – Upload, create operation, fetch status, and other business actions.
- **Service Layer** – Uploads to MinIO, validates file types and ownership, and interfaces with the task system.
- **Repository Layer** – Persists data in Postgres tables such as `developer_app_details`, `external_files`, `external_operations`, and `webhook_logs`.
- **Task System** – Kafka‑powered distributed workers that do the actual file processing.
- **Webhook Service** – Delivers async notifications with retry and HMAC signatures.

## Key Capabilities

- Upload any supported file type to regional MinIO storage.
- Create **operations** such as convert, compress, merge, zip, share, lock/unlock/reset password.
- Get operation **status** via polling or **webhooks**.
- Manage **API keys** and **webhooks** through the D3 dashboard.

All of these capabilities are exposed via the `/v1/biz` Business API surface. API keys and webhooks are managed through the dashboard at [dragdropdo.com/auth/signin](https://dragdropdo.com/auth/signin) in your Account section.
