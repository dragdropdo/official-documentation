# Business API overview

The Business API exposes a small, composable surface under the `/v1/biz` prefix:

- **Upload** – create presigned upload URLs and register uploaded files.
- **Operations** – create operations on uploaded files (convert, compress, merge, zip, share, lock/unlock, reset password).
- **Supported operations** – discover which operations and parameters are valid for a given file type.
- **Status** – check operation and per‑file status.

Developer‑facing management endpoints live under `/v1/developer`:

- **API keys** – create, list, expire, and delete API keys.
- **Webhooks** – register, list, and delete webhooks; inspect webhook audit logs.
- **Usage** – fetch aggregated Business API usage metrics.
