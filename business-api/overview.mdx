# Business API overview

The Business API exposes a small, composable surface under the `/v1/biz` prefix:

- **Upload** – create presigned upload URLs and register uploaded files.
- **Operations** – create operations on uploaded files (convert, compress, merge, zip, share, lock/unlock, reset password).
- **Supported operations** – discover which operations and parameters are valid for a given file type.
- **Status** – check operation and per‑file status.

API keys and webhooks are managed through the D3 dashboard:

- **API keys** – generate and manage API keys from your account dashboard
- **Webhooks** – register and manage webhooks from your account dashboard
- **Usage** – view your API usage and quotas in the dashboard

## Base URL

All examples in this documentation assume the following base URL:

```text
https://api.dragdropdo.com

Business API endpoints:
